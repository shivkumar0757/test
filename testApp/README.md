## 🌟 Overview

Our ecosystem consists of several integrated components:

- **Content Automation**: Transform YouTube videos into engaging LinkedIn posts with guided AI modes (expert, intermediate levels)
- **AI Leetcode Assistant**: Personalized learning paths with compensation insights and interview preparation
- **AI Agent Studio**: Create and deploy AI agents with a progression from coding to no-code interfaces
- **GSoC Contributions**: Open-source AI tools, benchmarking, and SDK development for Gemini APIs
- **ADN (AI Democracy Network)**: Decentralized compute-sharing with Web3 incentives

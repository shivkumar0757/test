# 🏗️ Project Structure Guidelines

This document outlines the agreed-upon structure for our AI-powered ecosystem project. Following these guidelines will ensure consistency and maintainability as the project evolves.

## 📂 Directory Structure Overview

```
/
├── docs/                       # Central documentation index
├── Documentation/              # Cross-component documentation 
├── ComponentName/              # Individual component directories
│   ├── README.md               # Component overview
│   └── Research/               # Component-specific research
├── MasterPlan.md               # Project blueprint
├── README.md                   # Project overview
└── ...                         # Other root-level documents
```

## 🚦 Key Principles for Managing Structure

1. **Component-Based Organization**
   - Each major component has its own top-level directory
   - Component-specific documentation stays within the component directory

2. **Central Documentation Hub**
   - `/docs` serves as a central index to all documentation
   - Cross-component documentation lives in `/Documentation`

3. **No Empty Directories**
   - Only create directories when you have content to put in them
   - Remove directories that become empty

4. **README Files**
   - Every component directory must have a README.md
   - READMEs should explain the purpose and structure of the directory

5. **Research Organization**
   - Component-specific research stays within the component's Research directory
   - Cross-component research goes in `/Documentation/Research`

## 🧭 When to Create New Directories

Create a new directory only when:
1. You have actual content to place in it
2. The content logically belongs together
3. There are at least 2-3 files that will live in the directory

## 🔄 Directory Structure Management

### Adding New Components

When adding a new component:
1. Create a top-level directory for the component
2. Add a README.md explaining the component
3. Create a Research directory for research documents
4. Update the documentation index

### Adding Component Features

When implementing component features:
1. Create feature directories only when ready for implementation
2. Use intuitive naming for feature directories
3. Don't create placeholder directories for future features

## 📌 Directory Naming Conventions

- Use `kebab-case` for new directories
- Be descriptive but concise
- Be consistent with existing naming patterns

## 🔧 Maintenance Tasks

Periodically:
1. Check for and remove empty directories
2. Ensure all directories have appropriate README files
3. Update the documentation index with new content
4. Verify that all cross-references between documents work

# 📚 Documentation Directory

This directory serves as the central hub for accessing all documentation across our AI-powered ecosystem project.

## 📑 Contents

- **[index.md](index.md)**: Main documentation index providing links to all project documents
- Future documentation will be organized here for better accessibility

## 🔍 Purpose

This documentation directory was created as part of our project reorganization efforts to:

1. Provide a single entry point for all documentation
2. Improve navigation between related documents
3. Make it easier for new team members to find information
4. Support a more intuitive project structure

## 🔄 Current Structure

Currently, our documentation follows a component-centric approach:

- Component-specific documentation remains within each component's directory
- Cross-component and project-level documentation is in the `/Documentation` directory
- This `/docs` directory serves as a central index to all documentation

## 🚀 Usage

To navigate our documentation:

1. Start with the [index.md](index.md) file in this directory
2. Follow links to specific documents based on your needs
3. Use the [Navigation Guide](../Documentation/Navigation.md) for comprehensive guidance

## 📝 Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Keep component-specific documentation within the respective component directories
2. Add cross-component documentation to the appropriate section in `/Documentation`
3. Update the [index.md](index.md) file in this directory to include links to new documents

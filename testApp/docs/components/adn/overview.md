# üìö ADN (AI Democracy Network) Component

This directory contains all files related to the AI Democracy Network (ADN) component of our AI-powered ecosystem.

## üîç Component Overview

ADN is a decentralized compute-sharing community with Web3 incentives. This long-term vision component aims to create a network where users can share computing resources for AI tasks and receive incentives through blockchain technology.

## üîÑ Current Status

The ADN component is in the conceptual phase. We have completed our initial research on decentralized ecosystems and developed a vision for democratizing AI access. We plan to develop a comprehensive whitepaper outlining the vision, technical architecture, and implementation roadmap.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To work on this component, familiarize yourself with the research documentation and immediate tasks:

1. Review the [ADN Whitepaper Research Framework](Research/ADNWhitepaperResearch.md)
2. Study the [ADN Insights](Research/ADNInsights.md) to understand our vision for democratizing AI
3. Check the immediate tasks in [ImmediateTasks.md](../Documentation/NextSteps/ImmediateTasks.md)
4. Review the technical specifications (once available)
5. Contribute to research on Web3 integration and token economics

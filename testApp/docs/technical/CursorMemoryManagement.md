# üß† Cursor Memory Management Guide

## Overview

This document provides strategies for managing memory usage when using Cursor for long-term projects. Cursor can consume significant memory during extended sessions, particularly with AI assistance features. This guide will help you maintain performance while working on our AI ecosystem projects.

## üîç Memory Issues in Cursor

Cursor can experience memory leaks, especially during:
- Long chat sessions with AI assistants
- Working with large codebases
- Having multiple files open simultaneously
- Running extensions

## üìã Memory Management Strategies

### 1. Project Documentation Segmentation

Our primary strategy is to segment our documentation into focused, smaller files:

```
Documentation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Progress/          # Historical changes (append only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NextSteps/         # Current and upcoming tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Technical/         # Component-specific technical details
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Teaching/          # Onboarding and educational materials
```

This approach allows you to:
- Load only the relevant documentation for your current task
- Maintain context without overwhelming Cursor
- Track progress across discrete files

### 2. Regular Session Management

#### Daily Workflow

1. **Start Fresh**: Begin each day with a new Cursor session
2. **Session Checkpoints**: Save your work and restart Cursor every 2-3 hours
3. **Close Unused Windows**: Keep only relevant files open

#### Conversation Management

1. **Summarize Long Conversations**: When conversations get lengthy, ask the AI to summarize the key points and decisions
2. **Create Documentation**: Move important insights to appropriate markdown files
3. **Start New Conversations**: Begin fresh conversations for new topics rather than continuing very long threads

### 3. Technical Solutions

#### Restart with Reduced Memory

```bash
# Restart Cursor with extensions disabled
cursor --disable-extensions
```

#### Memory Monitoring

Monitor Cursor's memory usage through:
- Activity Monitor (Mac)
- Task Manager (Windows)
- htop or top (Linux)

When memory usage exceeds 8GB, consider restarting Cursor.

### 4. Our Documentation System for Memory Management

#### Progress Tracking

- **Daily Log**: Update `Documentation/Progress/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with daily accomplishments
- **Component Updates**: When completing milestones, update the relevant component progress file
- **Weekly Summary**: Create weekly summary files that consolidate daily progress

#### Context Restoration

To quickly restore context after restarting Cursor:

1. Review `Documentation/NextSteps/ImmediateTasks.md`
2. Check the most recent progress log
3. Open only the component files you're currently working on

## üîÑ Regular Documentation Updates

### Weekly Process

1. **Progress Review**: Every Friday, review all progress logs from the week
2. **Update Next Steps**: Revise `ImmediateTasks.md` with adjusted priorities
3. **Create Weekly Summary**: Consolidate learnings and progress
4. **Technical Documentation**: Update any technical specifications based on the week's work

### Component Updates

When significant progress is made on a component:

1. Update the corresponding technical specification
2. Document any API changes
3. Update relevant diagrams
4. Create or update user guides as needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Memory Issue Troubleshooting

If you experience severe memory issues despite these strategies:

1. **Clear Cache**: Close Cursor and clear its cache directories
2. **Reduce Project Size**: Use `.gitignore` to exclude large files/directories
3. **Disable Features**: Turn off language servers or extensions you don't need
4. **Segment Work**: Focus on one component at a time

## üîç Monitoring Documentation Health

Use these indicators to assess if our documentation strategy is working:

- Cursor is responsive throughout the workday
- Team members can quickly understand the current state of the project
- Documentation remains current and useful
- Progress is clearly tracked and visible
- Memory issues are infrequent and quickly resolved

By following these strategies, we'll maintain productivity while managing Cursor's memory limitations.
